Blue Lantern — Security Pack (Sole Proprietor)
Date: 2025-09-06

Scope
- Single-user personal finance analytics (read-only). No payments or funds movement.
- No multi-tenant production. No customer data. Only the owner’s own bank and card data via Plaid Transactions.

1) Hosting Strategy
- Strategy: No hosted server-side components. ETL and analytics run on the owner’s workstation (Windows 10/11) and/or a private VM. An optional webhook may be hosted later using a serverless function (for example, Cloud Run or Azure Functions) with HTTPS and IP-restricted triggers.
- Secrets: Stored in environment variables (.env) and the local OS keychain where available. No credentials are logged.
- Data at rest: Encrypted disk (BitLocker or FileVault) and a password manager for secrets.
- Data in transit: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ only (Plaid endpoints).

2) Information Security Policy (Summary)
- Governance: The owner maintains a concise policy covering access, data handling, logging, retention, and incident response.
- Least privilege: Only the owner has access. No contractors. No shared accounts.
- Logging: Non-sensitive request IDs only; no PII, credentials, or bank usernames in logs.
- Retention: Data retained for rolling analysis; delete on request or disconnection.
- Incident response: Revoke tokens, rotate secrets, review logs, and reissue keys.
- Review: Policy reviewed at least annually or when architecture changes.

3) Asset Management
- Inventory: Single workstation and optional VM listed in an asset inventory (hostname, OS, serial, encryption status, last patch date).
- Discovery: Manual verification quarterly; OS settings checked monthly.
- Backups: Important configuration files backed up to an encrypted drive.

4) Vulnerability Management
- Patch management: Automatic OS updates enabled; third-party applications updated monthly.
- Scanning: Windows Security/Defender baseline scanning weekly; browser extensions audited quarterly.
- Remediation: Critical updates applied as soon as practicable; services restarted as needed.

5) Endpoint Security
- Controls: Full-disk encryption (BitLocker or FileVault), firewall enabled, Windows Defender (or equivalent) real-time protection, SmartScreen/Quarantine enabled, Secure Boot/TPM enabled.
- Hardening: BIOS/UEFI password set; remote desktop disabled unless required.
- Data loss: No public file sharing; removable media encrypted.

6) BYOD Policy
- Allowed: Yes, for owner devices only. No contractors.
- Requirements: Full-disk encryption, screen lock ≤ 5 minutes, OS up to date, real-time anti-malware enabled, MFA on Apple/Google account and password manager.
- Prohibited: Storing secrets in plain text or screenshots of keys. No public Wi-Fi without VPN.

7) Access Controls
- Production data: Only the owner has access to Plaid tokens and the local dataset.
- Secrets: Stored in environment variables and a password manager; never committed to code or logs.
- Access review: Reviewed quarterly; revoke any unused tokens immediately.

8) Strong Authentication
- MFA required on: Plaid Dashboard, email, password manager, GitHub, and any cloud provider used.
- Workstation: Password or biometric plus PIN; auto-lock enabled.
- Recovery: Backup codes for critical accounts; stored offline securely.

Appendix: Data Flow
- Plaid Link → access_token stored locally → scripts/fetch_plaid.py writes raw CSV → run_pipeline.py enriches → Power BI reads out/transactions_enriched.csv.
- Webhooks (optional) will be added later; when enabled, the endpoint will require HTTPS and secret verification.
